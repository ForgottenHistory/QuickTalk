# Quicktalk

Quicktalk is a real-time chat application that connects users with AI characters for 15-minute conversation sessions. Built with React and Node.js, the app features timed conversations where both the user and AI can choose to extend sessions for another 15 minutes, or automatically connect to a new AI character with a unique personality. The application includes customizable settings for session duration, AI model parameters, and response styles, all managed through a modern interface with WebSocket communication.
